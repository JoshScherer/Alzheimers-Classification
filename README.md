# Important Notes

* We did not include the data directory inside of the repository to avoid file size issues with GitHub
* Services such as AWS may be used to avoid local storage if desired, but is not required

# Instructions for Obtaining Data
* Go to https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uraninjo/augmented-alzheimer-mri-dataset
* Download the dataset. It should be in a zip file called archive.zip
* Extract all files into a sibling directory from this repository called data

# Current Plan for Development
TODO: Fill this in
